Narrative:
As a Rapid Rewards member user in southwest.com or swabiz.com
I want to have San Juan city available on the Destination Finder map page
So that I can use SJU in any of the functionalities offered there

Scenario:
Given I am logged in as Rapid Rewards member
When I am on the Destination Finder Page
And I select ATL as departing city
And I do a mouseover action on SJU city
Then I see San Juan Info container fly out message
